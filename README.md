# CodeClauseInternship_chatbot
 Here's a simple chatbot using Python and the Natural Language Processing libraries (NLTK).
 How It Works:
- Predefined Response Pairs: The chatbot uses a list of predefined patterns and responses.
- NLTK's Chat Class: This handles pattern matching and automatic response selection.
- Reflections: This helps in converting "I" to "you" and vice versa (e.g., "I am fine" â†’ "You are fine").
- User Interaction: The script runs in a loop allowing conversation until the user types "quit".
